The last few years in the gaming sector have been where I have grown the most personally and professionally, facing all kinds of challenges and meeting exceptional people.\nI consider myself a lifelong learner, always thirsty for knowledge and eager to explore new technologies.\nCreating an immersive and disruptive experience with deep emotional content is not only one of my goals but also part of my growth and evolution.\nI do sports to disconnect and recharge, as well as spend time with my family. At night, I usually continue studying to delve deeper into this wonderful world of technology. There is always something new to learn, whether it‚Äôs reading books, watching videos, taking courses, or writing notes. Besides that, the best way to learn is by doing, not just watching others do it. Therefore, I dedicate time to creating projects or proof of concept on topics I want to delve into and master to later apply them in my work or future projects.
