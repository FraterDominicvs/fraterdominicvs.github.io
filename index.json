That day Edward invoked whoever would listen to him from beyond, from another galaxy, or who knows where, to free him from his bad luck\u0026hellip;And he was heard; Edward transformed himself, just as Gregorio Samsa did, into an insect; the good luck insect!; a cricket First he called his girlfriend who, upon seeing him, couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe what she saw. -Finished! – was what he said. This is how family and even friends passed, who little by little abandoned him; The only one who did not abandon him was Pedro, one of those friends to whom Edward did not pay much attention.\nPedro visited Edward every day since he acquired his insectoid form, and his luck changed completely; so much so that: The casino that Pedro went to, he broke the bank! Woman he wanted, he had her! Edward acquired so much fame, due to his good luck, that his relatives returned to him, and OH surprise! They became rich, his girlfriend also returned and OH surprise! She also became rich.\nEdward, happy and excited, without caring about his appearance, showed himself in public. The result? They put him in a laboratory to investigate it, and Oh surprise!, the scientists\u0026rsquo; luck also changed. And since everything has a limit, and freedom is priceless, Edward escaped one moonless night, as a song from my childhood said, and went wherever the wind took him. He arrived at an unknown place, and the inevitable happened; When everyone saw him, they reacted in horror, and they even tried to kill him with insecticide. And he ran, or rather jumped, like he had never done before. He returned to his apartment and when he turned on the television he saw channels from all over the country. Confused, to calm his nerves, he smoked a pipe and went to sleep. They had told him that smoking that substance gives you wings and takes you through magical and pleasant worlds and that when you wake up everything would look different. And it was true, when he woke up he was alone, he felt bad, anxious, sad, without remembering his supposedly pleasant dreams, without friends, without a girlfriend, disowned by his family, and prisoner of a dream of smoke. In a moment of lucidity, he realized that he had dreamed it all. The phone rang, it was Pedro… that friend I didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to. – Put some clothes in a bag and let\u0026rsquo;s go together to seek freedom. I have the address; I lived in that place for some time and luckily I found it.\nAlthough the years lost are irrecoverable, it is important to treasure what has been learned. Edward knew how to value the difference between good and bad; the consequences that errors leave when they are not corrected in time, and how the essence of any spell is lost, which is nothing more than a balloon full of smoke. Edward stopped being a cricket, and many years later, sitting in his pine wood rocking chair, while enjoying a summer night, scented with jasmine and musicalized by the monotonous song of crickets, he remembered what lived and kept it forever in his thoughts, along with the small but important things in life.\nTHE WISE DRAGON\n","permalink":"https://www.joelaguilozi.com.ar/books/07/","summary":"Life\u0026rsquo;s little things © Joel Aguilozi, 2020\nTell the story\u0026hellip; no, it started badly, like it did a few years ago when I started writing, it definitely started badly, badly, like Edward Venit the day his life changed forever.\nOne day, Edward went to sleep, upset at his lack of luck; So much so that he earned the nickname \u0026ldquo;yeta Venit\u0026rdquo;.

He could not forgive me, and it was unfortunate that Iván did not fill that void for now. Sometimes while trying to fall asleep I ask myself, why does discrimination exist? Perhaps no one has the answer, perhaps the nature of human beings is to fear what is different, and put it aside without knowing what it is about, letting themselves be carried away by the canons of an intolerant society.\nI got up to have breakfast with Iván. We had already lived together for two years, and in the mornings we used to tell each other the dreams that had invaded our minds while we were sleeping. I, that night, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had dreams or nightmares, his smile didn\u0026rsquo;t calm me like it did every morning, and knowing him, I sensed that he was hiding something.\nIn a few seconds everything changed in both of our lives – Not long ago I was diagnosed with HIV – he said.\nThe first thing I thought was the most logical thing in those circumstances\u0026hellip; that meant that I also suffered from the disease. It was not the time to make reproaches or look for blame, the only thing I said to him was: – Why did it take you so long to tell me? \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how you were going to take it,\u0026rdquo; was the response. The first week was terrifying, the nightmares came back; Possibly they were trying to tell me that they had already warned me recently. In the middle of the night he woke up next to Iván, drenched in sweat and shaking with fear of what was coming. I remembered that God exists and I fervently asked him not to be true.\nThe first month passed, and after the studies, I knew that at most we had a few more years to live, but that was when everything changed for me, and for Iván. We decided to accept things as they were, to move on with our lives. We made those last years our most valuable treasure.\nEvery moment, every day, was full of joy, and without realizing it we discovered how to find happiness despite our great problems. We learned that death is not the end of everything; that happiness is in front of us and sometimes we don\u0026rsquo;t find it. I had to go through that, to understand that life is made up of moments and it is up to us to illuminate them or leave them in the dark.

Indeed he was a simple human, that\u0026rsquo;s what it was about, in my mind he was again a simple human. Even though fear had not yet invaded me, I climbed the stairs at a slow pace and with the creaking of the wood my ears seemed to be destroyed. The house that preserved its horrible state was very elegant, different exotic ornaments decorated the living room. I stopped to examine them for a moment, and saw that they were the heads of demons that I knew from having been in hell itself.\nThe door of the room where the ghost entered was in front of me, I still didn\u0026rsquo;t feel afraid, \u0026ldquo;maybe hell trained me well\u0026rdquo; I thought; I tried to open it but it was impossible, the handle, covered by rust, simply gave way on its own and I gained courage. Machine Translated by Google\nI asked her the reason for her insistence and she didn\u0026rsquo;t say a word, I walked closer, and upon seeing her more closely; I thought I saw a woman\u0026rsquo;s face, with short hair, it was unrecognizable. A bandage soaked in blood covered them; My calculations were incorrect, he slowly slid the blindfold off and showed me the holes where his eyes were supposed to be; someone had torn it off; What horror, I felt nauseated but I reflected, this is my mind, and if it is mutilated like this it is because of me, or perhaps\u0026hellip; I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to understand it, but that was the reason why the demons chose me. My mind was worse than hell itself, or maybe I was worse than hell and all the demons combined. Suddenly and in the continuous murmur, the creature pointed at me with his index finger. between. For the second time my nerves tried to explode, but I was stronger and entered. The ghost was in front of me and getting closer tried to whisper something to me. Look at his eyes, and notice that they were bleeding.\nDressed in white silk, she dropped coins on her right and left sides. I moved forward, just moved forward, nervous and trembling, I passed over it, crossing it, and when I did, a vision entered my eyes, and I saw terror, the terror of the human being that I hated so much, and weaned. The damage was done, now my mind was not a refuge, rather it was another hell. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do and I ran towards the door that connected to the other room and when I found the exit that represented the end of my torment, I saw a scale, and I finally understood: \u0026ldquo;Gouge out the eyes of justice, which is blind, and I have also swallowed them\u0026rdquo;, that pain that lurked like a scorpion needle in my stomach was his eyeballs; My own justice showed her the darkness and she in return and as punishment gave me true pain. The true pain of judging, without wanting to be judged.\n","permalink":"https://www.joelaguilozi.com.ar/books/02/","summary":"The Last Consolation © Joel Aguilozi, 2020\nI was running in a forest.

Paradoxes exist, many of us ignore them,\rand for some they can become a more than disastrous reality.\rBuenos Aires. March 2017. Félix got up like any other day, at six in the morning. He had toast with raspberry jam for breakfast. For more than a year he had wanted a change in his life, routine, boring, according to him tired of everything, the office, physical activity, his girlfriend.\nHe thought about some facts and in his thoughts he changed them to others at the moment when the spoon fell to the floor generating an unbearable sound. He felt dizzy, he walked to the bathroom, he noticed that the photo of his mother on the dresser had a hole in it, that was not normal.\nHe entered the bathroom and everything was in order, but when he came out the reality was different. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know where I was. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t his room. He was scared, \u0026ldquo;they have kidnapped me and drugged me\u0026rdquo; was the first thing he thought. He looked around. He looked at the photo of his mother where it said \u0026ldquo;I will never forget you.\u0026rdquo;\nI will give\u0026quot; was his handwriting, however he did not remember writing it. Scared, he called his mother\u0026rsquo;s house, wrong number?\nHis apartment looked different, it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem the same, it was more luxurious, elegant, orderly. Confused he went out into the street. The building where I lived was also different, like the streets, and the entire city. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know where I was, what year it was, and what I was doing there; He asked for information and they looked at him like a \u0026ldquo;crazy\u0026rdquo; person. Finally someone told him that it was the year 2040 and he was in the city of “Aires de Omega”. Increasingly confused, he began to think he might be dreaming. He used every resource to try to wake up and it was useless.\nHow could the year 2040 be? Did he travel in time? It couldn\u0026rsquo;t be true. He tried to put his mind together, what had he done to produce this change? Didn\u0026rsquo;t his mother exist in this world? Or it could be that\u0026hellip; He called his girlfriend, and no one answered.\nHe turned on the shower; perhaps a bath would clear it up. The phone rang, he hesitated to answer it, but he picked up the tube. It was a certain Alfredo who claimed to be his \u0026ldquo;psychiatrist.\u0026rdquo; Félix, increasingly confused, asked about his mother, and from the other side he heard an expression of disappointment, followed by:\n–The medication is not working, see me tomorrow at my consulting room.\n-But why? –Félix asked excitedly. Someone who explain to me Alfredo was silent for a few seconds, then he said: –Félix, your mother died more than ten years ago.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s when Felix\u0026rsquo;s head clicked and then exploded\u0026hellip;literally\u0026hellip;Apparently the changes he wanted worked in such a way that they built a new world of nightmares, like a diabolical game. In his mind, like a flash, a falling spoon appeared.\nHe tried to repeat the sequence again to try to understand these disastrous events that now constituted this present. The sunlight shone again with blinding force. He opened his eyes and his room changed again; This time it was a disaster; a complete disaster, worn out, abused.\nThe photos corroded by the fungus on the walls seemed a sad reflection of their past. Someone knocked on the door, it was the janitor. He saw its horns and demonic appearance. And finally he understood everything. \u0026ldquo;It was you,\u0026rdquo; he told her.\n–You are wrong, Félix, you were able to change realities, something that demons cannot do, except me, of course, we use you, to contradict the laws of nature.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to think. Was he going crazy? What if he ran away? But from what? From whom? It was likely that what was happening was a hallucination, but he had long since given up the joint. He thought of a way to not contradict nature, and tried to erase the demon that was using him as a floor rag to have fun for a while. I thought that would fix everything. However, that reality changed again and this time he found himself in hell itself, why? he asked himself. Eliminating that demon meant returning to normal, but he was wrong.\n\u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t eliminate someone superior to you,\u0026rdquo; Pharox told him. Demon controller of time and space – That daring can turn your world into true torment.\nA terrifying sound diverted his attention. Through the window He saw the flight of a horrendous creature. The sky was covered. Of them, had Felix caused the end of the world?\nHe cried out of helplessness and despair. He escaped. In the streets he found what he was looking for; a different but unwanted reality; The desire of his anxiety to be something he was not had taken him to that limit. Suddenly the demons followed him everywhere. He wandered the world, alone, surrounded by hideous creatures. Suddenly it appeared Pharox.\n– Don\u0026rsquo;t you think the landscape is beautiful? -asked. Humanity was over, it was their fault, there was no doubt. After walking for a long time he began to get used to that world until that reality too faded. He understood what his true power was; that of changing your karma with thought.\nAnd so Félix realized that desires condemn us to our own destiny.\n\u0026ldquo;Even though you haven\u0026rsquo;t answered me, I forgive you, because I see that you are in a moment of reflection,\u0026rdquo; Pharox told him, appearing out of nowhere again.\nFelix walked to hell now located on earth, the paradoxes getting worse every time. His house, his room were a thing of the past, now they belonged to another world, which after all he did not dislike so much.\nSomething peculiar was that he did not feel guilt, the same one that eats away at our heads when we believe that we are guilty of everything around us, and are we?\nPharox, tired of having fun with Félix, proposed a macabre game, imagining the worst reality; the most catastrophic for both.\nEven though he had just learned about his powers, Félix accepted the challenge. They would play with their imagination until they found each other\u0026rsquo;s weakest point. The prize for Félix would be to return to reality; to his world, the one he knew. And Pharox would keep Felix\u0026rsquo;s soul and his powers to be a complete entity.\n– What do you mean by becoming a complete being? –Asked Félix who already tasted victory.\nPharox lit his pipe, which emitted a strange, nauseating-smelling smoke, while he explained to Felix that he was his other half; and that once complete he would rule hell and earth. But enough of words. The game had to start.\nThey sat at a round table with strange engravings, which looked familiar to Felix. The two would imagine the perfect nightmare for the other. Pharox started. Felix suddenly found himself in a world surrounded only by darkness, and a crimson light that showed him the way forward. He moved forward trusting his instinct.\nNothing scared him.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought the worst fear of human beings was loneliness and darkness,\u0026rdquo; said Pharox, smoking his pipe. Not for Félix, who managed to banish that nightmare. They returned to the imaginary board, it was Félix\u0026rsquo;s turn.\nHe imagined a temple, a church, Pharox laughed out loud. –That doesn\u0026rsquo;t scare anyone, my dear Félix, in fact, I invite you to smoke the moss of hell with me before you lose.\nThe world that Pharox projected for Felix was a reality where demons committed the worst atrocities, which were enhanced by the smoke that invaded his brain to the point of making him believe he would go mad. However, he was stronger than his opponent believed and managed to dominate his mind.\nWhen Pharox noticed that the moss in his pipe had run out, he proposed to Felix that he accompany him to the shore of the rivers of hell where they grew. \u0026ldquo;Maybe that was the reason\u0026rdquo; for that nauseating smell. Along the way they talked about everything that humanity went through until the end of their days. Little by little and despite being rivals, they became friends. They sat on a cliff and together they smoked more than necessary.\nRecess was over. The game had to continue. They returned to the board; the dark angel who watched over him disappeared. Where were we? –Felix said. I think it\u0026rsquo;s my turn. \u0026ldquo;If it\u0026rsquo;s your turn,\u0026rdquo; Pharox replied.\n– Felix imagined the worst for a demon; The same sky. He took Pharox to a place full of angels and shining golden lights. Pharox felt fear, and for the first time he tried to find the exit as quickly as possible; That world of angels and beings of light hammered his mind with songs and praises.\nAs Felix\u0026rsquo;s time expired, Pharox foresaw his own destruction, when the piercing cries of hell almost destroyed his ears, was it not an angelic song to him? Pharox felt the cold that human beings feel when they face a being from beyond. His turn came. If the darkness didn\u0026rsquo;t scare Felix, what was there left for him to do? He couldn\u0026rsquo;t create any reality. He felt defeated. Felix took pity on him and let his turn pass, did he really take pity? Or for the first time a human was torturing a demon? Could it be that the human is more destructive than Lucifer himself?\n“Don\u0026rsquo;t be too smart,” Pharox warned him. And he invited him to continue. It was his turn again, he would show Félix a world where his loved ones were murdered in the worst way; And so he did until Félix smiled again, so much so that he laughed out loud.\n–I think for the first time someone has made you nervous, right? Pharox angry with himself; He got up from the table and asked for two minutes, he had to clear his head or desperation would drive him crazy.\nThere was no doubt the roles were changed, a human being was causing terror to a demon. Félix approached him, and offered him\nHe put his pride aside, ended the game and let the world return to normal. Pharox shook the earth with a piercing scream and warned him not to underestimate him.\nWhen he calmed down and could think, he realized that what he had believed until now about Felix was a mistake; It wasn\u0026rsquo;t his other half, but someone, perhaps a chosen one, or an angel? If Pharox gave up it would be his end not only in the hell he planned to build on earth to betray Lucifer.\nHe closed his eyes and smoked more infernal moss, trying not to succumb to nervousness, and felt how the toxic cloud penetrated his being.\nWhen he opened them he found himself in Felix\u0026rsquo;s room; where it all began, Pharox, he knew that this was another trap of that imbecile human, besides, what could the human world do to a higher-ranking demon? Unfortunately for Pharox, the worst was yet to come.\n– \u0026ldquo;Humans can\u0026rsquo;t scare me\u0026rdquo; – he said to himself when he left the apartment, but no one noticed his presence, since for society he was like a ghost, they didn\u0026rsquo;t see him.\nHe experienced firsthand the misfortune of loneliness, of no one noticing his presence, of no one even speaking to him and, worse still, he could no longer return to the infernal land and continue with the game to win it and get out of that hell that was the human world.\nScared more than usual, he tried to remember how he entered that horrible world, and his memory marked the moment when his pipe began to smoke. Was it a nightmare, or was Felix the culprit?\nAnother torment of the human world was present, doubt. I don\u0026rsquo;t Great to find the solution to his problem, he wandered through the world tormented by doubt.\nHe hated human beings more; even more so since he felt humiliated by one of them. He went to the table; Felix, his worst nightmare, was waiting for him there.\n“I will only let you win on one condition,” said Pharox.\nWhich? – Know who you really are. Félix accepted the condition but still could not reveal the truth. He suggested calming his nerves since the worst for Pharox had not yet come. First he recommended that he tell him the truth, and that he explain why he had created that hell on earth. Pharox explained that his purpose was to use him to betray Lucifer; and banish it.\n\u0026ldquo;That was your worst mistake,\u0026rdquo; Félix told him, smiling as he undressed. It folded a never-before-seen potential of multicolored lights.\nThe world was populated with demons. Now Hell had increased its forces thanks to Pharox\u0026rsquo;s plan failing; another trap from Félix, a being capable of deceiving even the very saints.\n–Game Over, you fell into our trap. –Wait, what are you going to do with me? –Pharox said. –We are going to banish you to the paradox where the world continues to function; where you belong. You were causing a lot of trouble for both good and evil, – Wait!\u0026hellip; Mercy!\n–Goodbye Pharox. It was fun playing with you.\nThus Pharox began to completely disintegrate. Now his worst punishment would be to be reincarnated in the human world. Everything in that real ity was transformed into fortresses of evil, Félix\u0026rsquo;s dream was fulfilled.\nBut we still didn\u0026rsquo;t know his real name. Felix adjusted his wings and headed to the palace of his master Lucifer. As he walked he smoked the moss and the singing of the demons made him laugh.\nThe palace opened its immense doors, the questions did not cease to cease in the tormented mind of Pharox who now reincarnated as a human being continued to wonder: Who really was Felix? How could he live in the human world and not be affected if he is a demon?\nDressed in a black robe, Lucifer was waiting for him, – Good job Judas, he told him – master demon of lies, deception and betrayal – Felix laughed, he had finally left the past behind\u0026hellip; forever\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"https://www.joelaguilozi.com.ar/books/04/","summary":"The Pharox Paradox © Joel Aguilozi, 2020\nSometimes when we are not satisfied with our lives, with what we\rdo, we mistakenly wish for changes that did not occur, and we\rask ourselves, What if I had done this?
